Lying to the west of the Jordan Rift Valley, Palestine is, in tectonic terms, located in the \"northwest of the Arabian Plate\". \n",
            "A crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics, Palestine was among the earliest regions to see human habitation, agricultural communities and civilization. In the Bronze Age, the Canaanites established city-states influenced by surrounding civilizations, among them Egypt, which ruled the area in the Late Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, emerged in the interior, while kingdoms belonging to Philistia and Phoenicia ruled the Palestinian coast. The Assyrians conquered the region in the 8th century BCE, then the Babylonians c. 601 BCE, followed by the Persian Achaemenid Empire that conquered the Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE. Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire in the late 330s BCE, intensifying Hellenizing influences.\n",
            "In the late 2nd-century BCE Maccabean Revolt, the Jewish Hasmonean Kingdom conquered most of Palestine; the kingdom subsequently became a vassal of Rome, which annexed it in 63 BCE. Roman Judea was troubled by Jewish revolts in 66 CE, so Rome destroyed Jerusalem and the Second Jewish Temple in 70 CE. In the 4th century, as the Roman Empire adopted Christianity, Palestine became a center for the religion, attracting pilgrims, monks and scholars. Following Muslim conquest of the Levant in 636–641, ruling dynasties succeeded each other: the Rashiduns; Umayyads; Abbasids; the semi-independent Tulunids and Ikhshidids; Fatimids; and the Seljuks. In 1099, the First Crusade resulted in Crusaders establishing of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which was reconquered by the Ayyubid Sultanate in 1187. Following the invasion of the Mongol Empire in the late 1250s, the Egyptian Mamluks reunified Palestine under its control, before the region was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1516, being ruled as Ottoman Syria until the 20th century largely without dispute.\n",
            "During World War I, the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, favoring the establishment of a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine, and captured it from the Ottomans. The League of Nations gave Britain mandatory power over Palestine in 1922. British rule and Arab efforts to prevent Jewish migration led to growing violence between Arabs and Jews, causing the British to announce its intention to terminate the Mandate in 1947. The UN General Assembly recommended partitioning Palestine into two states: Arab and Jewish. However, the situation deteriorated into a civil war. The Arabs rejected the Partition Plan, the Jews ostensibly accepted it, declaring the independence of the State of Israel in May 1948 upon the end of the British mandate. Nearby Arab countries invaded Palestine, Israel not only prevailed, but conquered more territory than envisioned by the Partition Plan. During the war, 700,000, or about 80% of all Palestinians fled or were driven out of territory Israel conquered and were not allowed to return, an event known as the Nakba (Arabic for 'catastrophe') to Palestinians. Starting in the late 1940s and continuing for decades, about 850,000 Jews from the Arab world immigrated (\"made Aliyah\") to Israel.\n",
            "After the war, only two parts of Palestine remained in Arab control: the West Bank and East Jerusalem were annexed by Jordan, and the Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt, which were conquered by Israel during the Six-Day War in 1967. Despite international objections, Israel started to establish settlements in these occupied territories. Meanwhile, the Palestinian national movement gained international recognition, thanks to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), under Yasser Arafat. In 1993, the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and the PLO established the Palestinian\n",

            "The Southern Levant is a geographical region that corresponds approximately to present-day Israel, Palestine, and Jordan; some definitions also include southern Lebanon, southern Syria and the Sinai Peninsula. As a strictly geographical description, it is sometimes used by archaeologists and historians to avoid the religious and political connotations of other names for this area.\n",
            "Like much of Southwestern Asia, the Southern Levant is an arid region consisting mostly of desert and dry steppe, with a thin strip of wetter, temperate climate along the Mediterranean coast. Geographically it is dominated by the Jordan Valley, a section of the Great Rift Valley bisecting the region from north to south, and containing the Sea of Galilee, the Jordan River and the Dead Sea—the lowest point on the Earth's land surface.\n",
            "The Southern Levant has a long history and is one of the world's most intensively investigated areas by archaeologists. It is considered likely to be the first place that both early hominins and modern humans colonized outside of Africa. Consequently, it has a rich Stone Age archaeology, stretching back as early as 1.5 million years ago.  With one of the earliest sites for urban settlements, it also corresponds to the western parts of the Fertile Crescent.\n",

            "The Southern Levant refers to the lower half of the Levant but there is some variance of geographical definition, with the widest definition including Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, southern Syria, and the Sinai Desert. In the field of archaeology, the southern Levant is \"the region formerly identified as Syria-Palestine and including Canaan.\"\n",
            "Many scholars studying the region's archaeology have adopted the term Levant (including northern and southern halves) as the \"term of choice\" due to it being a \"wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus\" that does not have the \"political overtones\" of Syria-Palestine. A survey of North American dissertations shows the \"overwhelming emphasis and scope of these works has been the southern Levant, an area formerly identified as Syria-Palestine including Canaan\", but with most modern Ph.D. dissertations using the terms 'Israel' and 'Canaan'.\n",
            "The term \"Southern Levant\" has also been criticized as imprecise and awkward. The term Southern Levant has been described in academic discourse as a \"at least a strictly geographical\" description of the region, avoiding religious and political connotations of names such as \"Canaan\", \"Holy Land\", \"Land of Israel\", or \"Palestine\".\n",

            "The Southern Levant lies on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, in the world region known variously as the Near East, the Middle East or Western or Southwestern Asia. It is bordered to the east, southeast and southwest by the Syrian, Arabian and Sinai deserts, respectively. Some definitions include parts of these deserts in the region. The Litani River in southern Lebanon is commonly considered the dividing line between the Southern Levant and the Northern Levant (i.e. Syria), or sometimes the Orontes River, also in Lebanon.\n",
            "For the most part, the climate of the Southern Levant is arid or semi-arid, however a narrow strip along the coast experiences a temperate, Mediterranean climate due to its proximity to the sea. Average annual rainfall decreases sharply away from the coast, from over 1,000 millimetres (39 inches) per year in Galilee, to 200–400 millimetres (7.9–15.7 inches) in the Rift Valley, and less than 50 millimetres (2.0 inches) in the eastern deserts and the Negev. Across the region, precipitation is both highly seasonal―most rain falls between October and May, and hardly any in the summer—and subject to large, unpredictable inter-annual variation. Temperature is also highly variable, with cool winters and hot summers.\n",

As a left-arm spinner, he is a nightmare for batsmen on turning tracks, and as a lower-order batter, he has evolved into a reliable match-winner. However, it is his fielding that truly sets him apart; with a \"rocket arm\" and incredible reflexes, he is arguably the greatest Indian fielder of his generation. He remains a vital pillar of the Indian team across all formats.\n",

Legend has it that the drink was discovered by accident in ancient China around 2737 BC when wild tea leaves blew into the boiling water of Emperor Shen Nung. Over the centuries, tea evolved from a medicinal tonic to a sophisticated social ritual, eventually traveling along the Silk Road to reach Europe and the Americas. The global demand for tea shaped trade routes, sparked conflicts like the Opium Wars, and even triggered the American Revolution through the Boston Tea Party, proving that a simple leaf can alter the course of human civilization.\"\"\"\n",

        "Gothic architecture, which flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages, represented a revolutionary departure from the heavy, dim interiors of earlier Romanesque styles. By introducing the pointed arch, the ribbed vault, and the flying buttress, medieval architects were able to build much taller structures with thinner walls and massive windows. These innovations allowed cathedrals like Notre Dame in Paris to be flooded with natural light through intricate stained glass, which was intended to symbolize the divine. These soaring stone structures were not just places of worship but served as monumental expressions of engineering prowess and artistic devotion that continue to inspire awe centuries later.\n",

        "The English language is a linguistic mosaic, constantly shifting and absorbing new influences since its early beginnings as a collection of West Germanic dialects. Following the Norman Conquest in 1066, Old English was heavily influenced by French, which introduced thousands of words related to law, government, and high culture, such as \"court,\" \"judge,\" and \"cuisine.\" Over time, the language continued to evolve during the Renaissance by adopting Latin and Greek roots, and later through global trade and the internet. Today, English has become a global \"lingua franca\" used by over a billion people worldwide, characterized by its massive vocabulary and a unique ability to adapt to new cultural and technological shifts with ease.\n",
