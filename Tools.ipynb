November 17, 2025 - LangChain is an open source orchestration framework for the development of applications using large language models (LLMs), like chatbots and virtual agents . 1 week ago - LangChain is an open source framework for building applications based on large language models (LLMs). LLMs are large deep-learning models pre-trained on large amounts of data that can generate responses to user queries—for example, answering questions or creating images from text-based prompts. LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides a standard interface for integrating with other tools and end-to-end chains for common applications. Published December 12, 2025 August 19, 2025 - At its core, LangChain is a framework that handles all the tedious, repetitive stuff you’d otherwise have to code yourself when working with Large Language Models (LLMs).\n"
